>Luca is the original author of the OrientDB product and the main committer. In order to handle indexes in the most efficient way, Luca created the new MVRB-Tree algorithm (it was originally referred to as the RB+Tree but another different algorithm already exists with that name) as mix of Red-Black Tree and B+Tree. MVRB stands for Multi Value Red Black because it stores multiple values in each tree node instead of just one, as the RB-Tree does. MVRB-Tree consumes less than half the memory of the RB-Tree implementation, while maintaining the original speed and balancing the tree on insertion/update. Furthermore, the MVRB-Tree allows fast retrieval and storage of nodes in persistent mode. He is a member of the Sun Microsystems JDO 1.0 Expert Group (JSR#12) and JDO 2.0 Expert Group (JSR#243) that wrote the JDO standard.
